# Random-Cropper

## Introduction

Training data for both image classification and object detection can be sparse and insufficient, especially in fields computer science hasn't had a strong history of integration, such as plant science.  Manual curation of training data in such a situation can seem daunting, but **Random Cropper** can certainly help out.  This GUI-based application gives the user the ability to take a directory of images (maybe of a specific type of plant root system) and create many randomized sub-images that can be used to train a image classifier, or even used in a object detection model.
